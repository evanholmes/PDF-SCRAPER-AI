# Analyze Bid Opportunity

Analyze a bid opportunity and provide a recommendation. I'll need:

**Input the following details:**
- Opportunity title
- Description
- Municipality/organization
- Value (if known)
- Deadline

**I will analyze:**
1. **Keyword Match**: Run against our 40+ keyword database with weighted scoring
2. **Capability Match**: Compare against ALL-PRO SIGNS & WESTCOAST CNC equipment and expertise
3. **Tier Classification**: Recommend A (Direct), B (Assignment), C (Partnership), D (Brokering), or E (Archive)
4. **Win Probability**: Estimate based on fit, competition, and past performance
5. **Partner Suggestions**: If not Tier A, suggest potential partners from our network
6. **Next Steps**: Specific actions to take (bid directly, contact partner, monitor, etc.)

Provide a clear GO/NO-GO recommendation with reasoning.
