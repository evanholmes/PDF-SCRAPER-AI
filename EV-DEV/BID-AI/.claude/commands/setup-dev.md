# Development Environment Setup

Guide me through setting up the BID-AI development environment.

## Backend Setup
1. Check Python version (need 3.14+)
2. Create/activate virtual environment
3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
4. Verify PostgreSQL is running
5. Initialize database with `python scripts/init_database.py`
6. Test configuration with imports

## Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to `ui/` directory
2. Check Node/npm versions
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start dev server with `npm run dev`
5. Verify it's running at localhost:3000

## Verify Setup
- Test database connection
- Test keyword matcher
- Check that dashboard loads
- Confirm all environment variables are set

Walk me through each step and verify everything is working.
