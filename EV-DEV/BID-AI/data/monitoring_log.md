-

### If Aggregators Cover <80%
**Strategy**: Build individual scrapers for each municipality
**Priority order**:
1. BidsAndTenders platform scraper (17 municipalities)
2. High-value individual portals (Vancouver, Surrey, Metro Vancouver)
3. Direct website scrapers
4. Custom portals (TransLink, YVR, BC Hydro)
