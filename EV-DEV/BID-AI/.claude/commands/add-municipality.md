# Add New Municipality

Help me add a new municipality to the BID-AI system. I need:

1. Create a municipality profile in the appropriate tier directory (`municipalities/tier-X-XXX/`)
2. Add entry to `data/municipalities/bid_portals.csv`
3. Generate PROFILE.md with:
   - Municipality name and tier
   - Portal URL and login requirements
   - Procurement categories (signage, printing, etc.)
   - Typical bid value ranges
   - Agent team color for calendar integration
   - Key contacts (if available)

Follow the format used in existing municipality profiles (see `municipalities/tier-1-critical/vancouver/PROFILE.md` as example).

Which municipality would you like to add?
