# Code Review

Review the code in this project for:

1. **Code Quality**: Check for best practices, clean code principles, and maintainability
2. **Security**: Identify potential vulnerabilities, especially in database queries and user input handling
3. **Performance**: Look for optimization opportunities and bottlenecks
4. **Bugs**: Spot logical errors, edge cases, or potential runtime issues
5. **Architecture**: Ensure code follows the project's architectural patterns (see CLAUDE.md)

Focus on Python backend files and Next.js frontend components. Provide specific file paths and line numbers for issues found.
