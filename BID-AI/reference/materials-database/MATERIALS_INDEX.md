# Materials Database Index

## Purpose

This database serves as THE BID MASTER's reference for evaluating material specifications in RFPs/RFQs. When a contract specifies materials, THE BID MASTER cross-references against:

1. **Can THE PARENT COMPANY source this material?**
2. **What is the lead time?**
3. **What is the cost basis?**
4. **Are there approved alternatives?**
5. **What supplier relationships exist?**

## Specification Cross-Reference

When RFPs specify materials, THE BID MASTER should:

### Step 1: Identify Exact Specification
```
Example from RFP:
"Sign faces shall be 3mm aluminum composite panel (ACM), 
Dibond or approved equivalent, with 0.012" aluminum skins"
```

### Step 2: Check Fulfillment Status
- ✅ **Core Capability** = In-house, immediate
- ✅ **Available** = Reliable sourcing, standard lead time
- ⚠️ **Specialty Order** = Extended lead time, higher cost
- ⚠️ **Subcontract** = Partner required
- ❌ **Cannot Fulfill** = Outside capability

### Step 3: Note for Analyst Agent
- Material cost impact
- Lead time impact
- Alternative suggestions (if "or equivalent" permitted)
- Supplier confirmation needed
