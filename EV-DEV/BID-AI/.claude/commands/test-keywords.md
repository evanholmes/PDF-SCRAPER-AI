# Test Keyword Matching

Run the keyword matcher test to verify the filtering system is working correctly.

Execute:
```bash
python scripts/test_keyword_matcher.py
```

Then analyze the results and show:
1. Which test opportunities matched (and their relevance scores)
2. Which keywords triggered matches
3. Tier classification recommendations (A/B/C/D/E)
4. Any suggested improvements to keyword weights or new keywords to add

Reference the keyword configuration in `config/keywords.yaml` for context.
